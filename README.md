# aerospace-ml-and-pytorch-internship
This is an AI model I created to predict 4 target variables from aerospace structures, such as material type, altitude, density, etc. It was part of my internship under Dr. Selma Fekry of Labib AI, an AI startup based in Abu Dhabi.

This repo contains my AI internship work:
- **Deep Learning (PyTorch):** Multi-output neural net for 4 aerospace targets (3-class classification each).
- **Classical ML:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest baselines.
- Dataset: [Kaggle Aerospace Structural Design](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/aerospace-structural-design-dataset).
- Results: Accuracy plateaued ~38%, showing the limits of deep learning with small data.
- Key Learning: Importance of data size, stratified splits, classical vs deep ML.
- Link to project in case the collab file doesn't work (https://nbviewer.org/github/Yayadark/aerospace-ml-and-pytorch-internship/blob/main/Aerospace_Structural_Design_Dataset_Yahia_AlOmari.ipynb)
